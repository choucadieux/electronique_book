    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Electrical capacitance** represents the ability of a component to **store energy in the form of an electric charge**.\n",
    "It is measured in **farads (F)** and defined as the **ratio between the stored charge** on the plates of a capacitor and the **voltage applied** across them.\n",
    "The main device that exhibits this property is the **capacitor** itself.\n",

    "## Basic Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "A **capacitor** consists of **two conductive plates** separated by an **insulating material** known as the **dielectric**.\n",
    "When a voltage is applied between the plates, **positive charges** accumulate on one plate and **negative charges** on the other, creating an **electric field** across the dielectric.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ability to **store and release energy rapidly** makes capacitors essential in many electronic systems, such as **power supplies**, **signal filters**, and **timing circuits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamental Equation in Electronics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current–Voltage Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "The defining equation of a capacitor in the time domain is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "i(t) = C \\frac{du(t)}{dt}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the **current through the capacitor** depends on the **rate of change of the voltage** across it.\n",
    "In other words, a **faster voltage variation** leads to a **larger current**.\n",
    "A sudden change in voltage can therefore produce a **high inrush current**, which must be considered during circuit design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capacitor Impedance\n",
    "\n",
    "The complex impedance of a capacitor is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z_C = \\frac{1}{j \\omega C} = -\\frac{j}{\\omega C} = \\frac{1}{\\omega C} e^{-j \\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Several important observations can be made:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The impedance is **inversely proportional to frequency**:\n",
    "  – at **high frequencies**, the capacitor behaves like a **short circuit** (it passes AC easily);\n",
    "  – at **low frequencies**, it behaves like an **open circuit** (it blocks DC).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Frequency      | Impedance Behavior              |\n",
    "| -------------- | ------------------------------- |\n",
    "| $f \\to \\infty$ | $Z_C \\to 0$ (short circuit)     |\n",
    "| $f \\to 0$      | $Z_C \\to \\infty$ (open circuit) |"
