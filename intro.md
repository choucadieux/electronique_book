# Book on Electronics

The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive resource covering all aspects of electronics.  
Each chapter is divided into two main parts:  

1. **Theoretical Study** — including derivations, equations, and detailed explanations that show how results are obtained.  
2. **Simulation and Analysis** — using [PySpice](https://pyspice.fabrice-salvaire.fr/releases/v1.4/overview.html) to explore and better understand the behavior of electronic components in practice.  

This book represents the **first stage** of a much larger project.  
Knowledge should be **free and accessible to everyone**.  
The initial goal is to publish this book in English, and later translate it into several languages so that anyone with internet access can benefit from it.  

Ultimately, this initiative is part of a broader vision:  
to promote **open scientific research** by eliminating paywalled journals and creating a single, freely accessible platform for researchers and readers alike.  
All projects within this ecosystem will share a **common visual identity** — a recognizable logo that can vary slightly depending on the specific project.  

Finally, I truly value your feedback — whether it’s to improve sections of code, fix mistakes, or enhance clarity.  
Every contribution helps make this resource better for everyone.
